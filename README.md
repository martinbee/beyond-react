# Beyond 5/3/1 React

Beyond 5/3/1 is a workout routine created by Jim Wendler. This app was built for
my personal use to perform workout percentage calculations and to store my
workouts (my Evernote app was starting to suffer).

## Tools

This app uses create-react-app, es6, eslint for linting, babel behind the
scenes, and axios for api calls.

## Docs
[API](./docs/api.md)
[5/3/1 basic rules](./docs/rules.md)
[TODO](./docs/todo.md)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
